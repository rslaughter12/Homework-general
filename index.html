            <h2> About Me  </h2>
            <p>
              My name is Ryan Acevedo Slaughter, I am 25 years old and am from Clearwater Florida. I currently live in San Francisco when my wife and I moved here about two years ago. I graduated from Florida State University with a Master's Degree in Curriculum and Instruction. I am excited to become a software developer and make a career change when my course is completed. I hope to be working in the field during the summer of 2023.

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a full-time 9/10th grade World History Teacher at San Francisco International High School. This job has allowed me to engage and support students who have recently immigrated to the United States. This experience has helped me to develop a global lens, learn how to teach students who do not speak the same language as me, as well as allow me to practice and grow my Spanish proficiency. My coding experience is new and growing everyday. You can view my two main projects below.

                <h3>Project 2 Horiseon Refactor</h3>
                <p>In this project I was requiered to simplify code, make it more DRY. For this task I had to evaluate where the coding could be simplified in order to make it easier to read. Most adjustments came in CSS, applying same formatting to many attributes. </p>
