Week 2 Challenge

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a website that services as a portfolio. 

I was given no code and needed to start from the ground up. 

I started with basic skills that were taught during the first two weeks of class and then continued to build off of them and reference other ways to make them more efficient. 

Features that are present in the website:
UI scroll when section in top bar are selected
Flex box that contains photos, descriptions, and links of my current projects. 
Hover attribute that showcases that there is an active link.
It also includes a responsive webpage that is responsive at a max width of 700 as well as a common iphone 12 screen size. 

The page includes all requiered materials:
An about me section, name clearly labelled, updated photo, UI
scroll, live link photos, contact page, and responsive screen size. 

Where I have room to grow is making it more visually appealing in my flex boxes. They are there, they have all the information that they need for this assignment, however, I would like them to be more visually appealing in the future when I continue to grow and develop in my CSS skills.
